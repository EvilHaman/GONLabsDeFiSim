# TokenomicsSim
a python based DeFi simulator.

run the main.py function up to the run_sim() function to run the simulation.
then the rest of the functions would create various visualizations of the simulation.
note the functions are not in order, so you would have to run them in order to get the full picture.
sharpe_stats() is the function that would give you the sharpe ratio of each PM and in aggregate. this is a table, look at it directly.
the rest of the functions are visualizations (mainly).
